# Contributing
We love contributions to Poozle, big or small.

See our contributing guide on how to get started. Not sure where to start? We’ve listed some good first issues to start with. If you have any questions, please open a draft PR or visit our slack channel where the core team can help answer your questions.

Also, we will never ask you to maintain your extension. The goal is that the Poozle team and the community helps maintain it, let's call it crowdsourced maintenance!
