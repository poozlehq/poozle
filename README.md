    <em>Poozle is an open-source, fast and reliable platform to integrate data from external APIs via a single integration layer.
</em>
</p>

API Composition is a powerful pattern that enables you to interact with a diverse set of APIs as though they were a unified whole. By eliminating the need for glue code, it streamlines the integration process and provides a clearer understanding of an application's API dependencies. But do you truly understand the APIs your application relies on? Poozle can provide the answer, along with analytics and observability to assess the quality of service your API dependencies offer.

At Poozle, we're committed to an open-source approach to API integration, as we believe it's the only way to accommodate the long tail of API sources while allowing developers to tailor existing extensions to their needs. Our ultimate goal is to enable seamless integration with any API, and we offer extensions that can be implemented in [TypeScript](https://docs.poozle.dev/building_extension/overview) and packaged as Docker images in accordance with the Poozle specification. With this framework, creating new extensions is simple and fast.

Overall, Poozle makes API integration more manageable, efficient, and adaptable, allowing developers to focus on building great applications without being bogged down by integration challenges.
