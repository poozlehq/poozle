An order that a merchant creates on behalf of a customer. Draft orders are
useful for merchants that need to do the following tasks:

- Create new orders for sales made by phone, in person, by chat, or elsewhere.
When a merchant accepts payment for a draft order, an order is created.
- Send invoices to customers to pay with a secure checkout link.
- Use custom items to represent additional costs or products that aren't displayed in a shop's inventory.
- Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.
- Sell products at discount or wholesale rates.
- Take pre-orders.
- Save an order as a draft and resume working on it later.

For Draft orders in multiple currencies `presentment_money` is the source of
truth for what a customer is going to be charged and `shop_money` is an estimate
of what the merchant might receive in their local currency.

**Caution:** Only use this data if it's required for your app's functionality.

A **Fulfillment Service** is a third party warehouse that prepares and ships orders
on behalf of the store owner. Fulfillment services charge a fee to package and ship items
and update product inventory levels. Some well known fulfillment services with Shopify integrations
include: Amazon, Shipwire, and Rakuten. When an app registers a new `FulfillmentService` on a store,
Shopify automatically creates a `Location` that's associated to the fulfillment service.
To learn more about fulfillment services, refer to
[Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps)
guide.

## Mutations

You can work with the `FulfillmentService` object with the
[fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate),
[fulfillmentServiceUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceUpdate),
and [fulfillmentServiceDelete](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceDelete)
mutations.

## Hosted endpoints

Fulfillment service providers integrate with Shopify by providing Shopify with a set of hosted endpoints that
Shopify can query on certain conditions.
These endpoints must have a common prefix, and this prefix should be supplied in the `callbackUrl` parameter
in the
[fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate)
mutation.

- Shopify sends POST requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint
  to notify the fulfillment service about fulfillment requests and fulfillment cancellation requests,
  if `fulfillment_orders_opt_in` is set to `true`.

  [As of the 2022-07 API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/legacy-fulfillment-api-deprecation),
  it's mandatory for a fulfillment service to follow a fulfillment order based workflow by
  having `fulfillment_orders_opt_in` set to `true`,
  hosting the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint, and acting on fulfillment requests and cancellations.

  For more information, refer to
  [Receive fulfillment requests and cancellations](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-2-receive-fulfillment-requests-and-cancellations).
- Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_tracking_numbers` endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders,
  if `trackingSupport` is set to `true`.

  For more information, refer to
  [Enable tracking support](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-8-enable-tracking-support-optional).

  Fulfillment services can also update tracking information with the
  [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2) mutation,
  rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for tracking numbers.
- Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve inventory levels,
  if `inventoryManagement` is set to `true`.

  For more information, refer to
  [Sharing inventory levels with Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-9-share-inventory-levels-with-shopify-optional).

To make sure you have everything set up correctly, you can test the `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints
in your development store.

## Resources and webhooks

There are a variety of objects and webhooks that enable a fulfillment service to work.
To exchange fulfillment information with Shopify, fulfillment services use the
[FulfillmentOrder](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder),
[Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment) and
[Order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) objects and related mutations.
To act on fulfillment process events that happen on the Shopify side,
besides awaiting calls to `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints,
fulfillment services can subscribe to the
[fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
and [order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/webhook)
webhooks.

  - Shopify queries the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve inventory levels,

  After the product is created, you can activate the variants at locations

  each mutation and increases the likelihood that it will
  complete before the operation times out.

  1. Create the product with variants. Don't specify any tags or collections on the product, and don't specify
  [inventory quantities](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/ProductVariantInput#field-productvariantinput-inventoryquantities)

  2. After the product is created, add tags to the product using the
  [tagsAdd](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/tagsAdd) mutation, and add collections using the
  [collectionsAddProducts](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/collectionAddProducts) mutation.
  
  3. Use the [inventoryBulkToggleActivation](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/inventoryBulkToggleActivation) mutation
  on each [inventory
  item](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/InventoryItem) to
  activate it at the appropriate locations.
  
  4. After activating the variants at the locations, adjust inventory quantities at each location using the
  [inventoryBulkAdjustQuantityAtLocation](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/inventoryBulkAdjustQuantityAtLocation) mutation.

  The `ResourceFeedback` object lets your app report the status of shops and their resources. For example, if
  your app is a marketplace channel, then you can use resource feedback to alert
  merchants that they need to connect their marketplace account by signing in.
  
  Resource feedback notifications are displayed to the merchant on the home
  screen of their Shopify admin, and in the product details view for any
  products that are published to your app.
  
  This resource should be used only in cases where you're describing steps that
  a merchant is required to complete. If your app offers optional or promotional
  set-up steps, or if it makes recommendations, then don't use resource feedback
  to let merchants know about them.
  
  ## Sending feedback on a shop
  
  You can send resource feedback on a shop to let the merchant know what steps
  they need to take to make sure that your app is set up correctly. Feedback can
  have one of two states: `requires_action` or `success`. You need to send a
  `requires_action` feedback request for each step that the merchant is required to complete.
  
  If there are multiple set-up steps that require merchant action, then send
  feedback with a state of `requires_action` as merchants complete prior steps.
  And to remove the feedback message from the Shopify admin, send a `success`
  feedback request.
  
  #### Important
  Sending feedback replaces previously sent feedback for the shop. Send a new
  `shopResourceFeedbackCreate` mutation to push the latest state of a shop or
  its resources to Shopify.

An individual sale record associated with a sales agreement. Every money value
in an order's sales data is represented in the currency's smallest unit. When
amounts are divided across multiple line items, such as taxes or order
discounts, the amounts might not divide evenly across all of the line items on
the order. To address this, the remaining currency units that couldn't be
divided evenly are allocated one at a time, starting with the first line item,
until they are all accounted for. In aggregate, the values sum up correctly. In
isolation, one line item might have a different tax or discount amount than
another line item of the same price, before taxes and discounts. This is because
the amount could not be divided evenly across the items. The allocation of
currency units across line items is immutable. After they are allocated,
